Iolas Qintoras (full story)
</h1>
<p>
 He was walking to the market, and when he got there he saw the place was burnt and bodies with black fungus littered the streets. He remembered that there was an orphanage for young lings who had lost their parents in combat, hunting, or sickness. This drained his hope. He rushed to the orphanage to see if the horror reached it, what he saw was devastating: dead elf bodies were hung and lying everywhere all with the same black fungus growing on them. No matter the age, everyone was gone, worst was an infant, no less than 18 months old, priced by a spear, being cradled by the dead body of a priest. Then he notices, and he rushes home, but while he was running home he stepped into a snare trap and that’s when he saw a red figure with white eyes, the figure moves with inhuman speed and runs behind him and knocks him out with what felt like a rigid wooden club.
When he woke up, he was in the mountains, frigid, cold, and for an elf like him, certain death unless he acted fast, luckily he knew how to hunt, so he quickly fashioned a knife out of stone and flint, then he went hunting where he found a small rabbit. He didn’t want to eat it but he had to, he killed the rabbit and went to the bottom of the mountain to find firewood and luckily found a forest at the bottom of the hill and gathered some firewood. He felt awful eating a rabbit, elves are vegetarians, but he had to survive.

The next day he decided to go down to the forest to get food, berries and such. But when he went into the woods he stumbled upon a camp of gnorots: stout, furry, yet vicious, and murderous creatures. Seemingly everywhere they went, a new river was made, one of blood and dead bodies. He prayed to the gods that he would not be seen as he foolishly tried to sneak into the camp.

As he attempted to intrude on their territory, he stepped on a twig; just what he needed.  One of the gnorots heard him and signalled the others, as new vigour rushed through Iolas’s body as he rushed away, further and further, yet he could still listen to their grunts and shouts. When he managed to escape them he was in an unfamiliar area and he started to scout the area, this time he found a few berries to eat, dead animal hides and collapsed branches to make a small shelter. The next day, He woke up in a cold sweat as he remembered his slew bretheren. He didn’t have time to mourn, he could still hear the gnorots dirty boots thumping on the hard stone, serching for him. When he tryed to run, he slipped on a mossy rock and landed into the powerfull river below him.
